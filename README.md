bird-watching
Scott Monroe
==============
This application allows a user to add a BirdSighting object to a list that is displayed to the user.  The user can select any sighting from the master list and it will display the details on the sighting such as the location and time.  There are 3 main views in this application.  The master view shows all the sightings.  The detailed view shows the information on 1 sighting and the add view allows a user to add a sighting.

The main thing I learned from this project was linking of scenes and how to establish transitions between different veiws.  This is importmant because it showed how to controll flow in a simple program.  In the most simplified way you can link a button up to a navigation controller of any scene.
